\section*{Problem 1}
Let $E \colon \bits^n \times \bits^n \to \bits^n$ be a blockcipher,
and consider the following three functions, each mapping $\bits^n
\times \bits^n$ to $\bits^n$:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $f_1(V,M) = E_V(V \xor M) \xor M$
\item $f_2(V,M) = E_V(V \xor M) \xor V \xor M$
\item $f_3(V,M) = E_V(M) \xor V$
\end{enumerate}
Imagine that you are an attacker, and you would like to exhibit
collisions in these functions.  Specifically, for each~$i=1,2,3$, you need
to find two pairs of inputs  $(V,M) \neq (V',M')$ such that
$f_i(V,M) = f_i(V',M')$.  

Your attacks are mounted in the ideal cipher
model for~$E$, so assume that you are given oracles for
$E(\cdot,\cdot)$ and $E^{-1}(\cdot,\cdot)$.  To the former oracle, you
may ask $(K,X)$ and receive $Y \gets E_K(X)$ in return; to the latter oracle,
you may ask $(K,Y)$ and receive $X \gets E^{-1}_K(Y)$ in return.  Your
attacks should be as efficient as possible, i.e.\ ask as few oracle
queries as you can.

If you find that one or more of $f_1,f_2,f_3$ is does not yield
collisions in a reasonable number of queries, you might take off your
``attacker hat'' and put on your ``prover hat'', to see if you can
argue that query-efficient attacks are unlikely to exist.  (Ask
yourself: what is the maximum number of queries that you can hope to
force an attacker to make for a $2n$-bit to $n$-bit mapping?)

\section*{Problem 2} Let~$F \colon \bits^k \times \bits^* \to \bits^n$
be a function family, and let $\Pi = (\calK,\calE,\calD)$ be an
encryption scheme.  Consider the following encryption scheme $\oPi =
(\ocalK,\ocalE,\ocalD)$ where 
\[
\ocalE_{K1,K2}(M) = \calE_{K1}(M)\concat F_{K2}(K1 \concat M)\, .
\]  
To decrypt, $\ocalD_{K1,K2}(C)$
operates as follows: (1) parse~$C$ into $Y \concat T$ where $|T|=n$; (2) $X
\gets \calD_{K1}(Y)$, and if~$X = \bot$ then return~$\bot$; (3) if
$F_{K2}(K1 \concat X)=T$ then return~$X$, else return $\bot$.

\paragraph{Part 1.} Assume that~$F$ is a good PRF, and that $\Pi$ is IND\$-CPA secure.
Are these assumptions sufficient to prove that $\oPi$ is IND\$-CPA
secure?  If so, please give a detailed proof sketch (i.e. how would
the proof be structured, what reductions would be necessary and how
would they work, etc.), and what you expect will be the security
bound.  If not, please give an efficient attack.

\paragraph{Part 2.} Are these assumptions sufficient to prove that $\oPi$ is AUTH-secure?
If so, please give a detailed proof sketch (as above), and what you
expect will be the security bound.  If not, please give an efficient attack.
